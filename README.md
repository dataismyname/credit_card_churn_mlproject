This is an end-to-end machine learning project developed as a personal initiative to simulate a real-world business case and enhance my data science, MLOps, and cloud deployment skills.

The goal is to predict customer churn (i.e., whether a credit card user is likely to cancel their card) using a binomial classification model with over 90% accuracy.  
It includes **data exploration**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, and **deployment of a prediction API** using **Flask**, all containerized with **Docker**.

The solution is deployable both locally and in the cloud. It includes a working **CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions**, and has been successfully tested on:

- **Azure App Service** (Web App for Containers) via GitHub integration  
- **AWS EC2** (Docker-based deployment)

## üìÅ Installation

### Using Docker

#### 1. Pull the Pre-Built Image
```bash
docker pull data5639/creditcardchurn-app-v0.0.1:latest
docker run -p 8080:8080 data5639/creditcardchurn-app-v0.0.1:latest
```

#### 2. Build the Image Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dataismyname/credit_card_churn_mlproject.git
cd credit_card_churn_mlproject
docker build -t churn-prediction:local .
docker run -p 8080:8080 churn-prediction:local
```

Your application should now be accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

#### 3. Test the API
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"customer_id": 123, "balance": 1000, "transactions": 15}' \
    http://localhost:8080/predict
```

### Local Setup (Without Docker)

1. Install Python 3.8+
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the app:
```bash
python application.py
```

## üåê Optional: Deployment on AWS EC2

Instructions for deploying the project on an AWS EC2 instance using Docker.

1. SSH into your EC2 instance.
2. Install Docker:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get-docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
newgrp docker
```
3. Pull and run the Docker image:
```bash
docker pull data5639/creditcardchurn-app-v0.0.1:latest
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 data5639/creditcardchurn-app-v0.0.1:latest
```
